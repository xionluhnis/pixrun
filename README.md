pixrun
======

Prototype parser for the .PIXRun files generated by
[Microsoft PIX](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/manders/archive/2006/12/15/a-painless-introduction-to-pix-for-windows.aspx).

Usage
=====

    ./pixrun.py myfile.pixrun [verbosity]

Displays information about the pixrun frames and content, with *verbosity*, the level of information being output: 0=silent, 1=minimal, 2=basic, 3=verbose, 4=alldata 

    ./count_frames.py myfile.pixrun


Counts the number of frames in a pixrun file.

    ./copy_frames.py inputfile.pixrun outputfile.pixrun [ranges...]

Copy the frames from an input file to an output frame, only keeping a set of frames.
Examples of range:

* `1,2,3`: frames 1, 2 and 3
* `1:3` : frames 1 to 3 (included)
* `1:2:5` : frames 1 to 5, stepping by 2 => 1,3,5
* `1,100:200` : frames 1 and from 100 to 200 (included)


Limitations
===========
The main limitation at this stage is that since frames might contain data that is required by other frames,
cutting arbitrary frames might render the result useless (PIX will crash when trying to use texture/vertex data
that hasn't been created).

Using only the pix data, one has to filter frames that can be cut out or not, but given the number of DirectX calls
that can lead to invalid states, this has not been implemented.

* The [Attila Project](http://attila.ac.upc.edu) also has a PIXRun parser, and it recently released its
  [source code](http://attila.ac.upc.edu/wiki/index.php/Downloads).  It also provides many
  [traces](http://attila.ac.upc.edu/traceList/).
* [AMD GPU PerfStudio](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/gpu-perfstudio/) can capture frames   at any moment and analyze them (geometry, depth, shaders) but only support DirectX11
* [Nvidia NSight](http://www.nvidia.com/object/nsight.html) has tools for GPU debugging with a better support for
  DirectX
